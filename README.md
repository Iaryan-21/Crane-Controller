# Crane-Controller

To design controller and observer for the system which can control the loads suspended from the cables of the crane. The project flows in steps, starting from deriving the equation of motion of the system. Then, linearizing the system at equilibrium points, designing an LQR controller in SIMULINK, designing a Luenberger Observer for both linear an well as non-linear system. The calculations on non-linear system is computed using ode solver Ode45. Finally, designing a LQG controller using Kalman Filter and LQR Controller.
